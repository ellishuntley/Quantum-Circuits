# Quantum-Circuits

Quantum computing is a field that harnesses quantum mechanics to enable more efficient computations compared to classical computers. Central to quantum computing is the qubit, which serves as the fundamental unit of quantum information and can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 states.

The simulation of quantum circuits is well-suited for an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach using C++. The OOP paradigm is extensively applied in the program, utilising its core concepts for designing and implementing the simulation. Encapsulation bundles data and corresponding functions into coherent units, while inheritance facilitates the creation of derived classes for implementing quantum gates and operations.

The program employs runtime and compile-time polymorphism by using a base quantum gate class and a template class for generating controlled versions of single-qubit gates. These techniques contribute to a more intuitive and flexible interface when working with quantum circuits and gates. The program also incorporates advanced features, such as header files, smart pointers, and exceptions to enhance the overall structure, efficiency, and robustness of the program.

This repository contains all of the class header files and main functions, seperately or as .zip, if you wish you link files. Alternatively, the entire program is available in the 'QuantumCircuits.cpp' file also found in this repository.
